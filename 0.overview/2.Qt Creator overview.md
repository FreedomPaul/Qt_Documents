application using Qt Creator, shortcuts, and practical tips for developers.

Qt Creator can make your Qt learning easier with many useful tools and examples. You will

on your favorite desktop platform, as well as being aware of the advanced options available 
in the IDE, which you will be able to customize in line with your preferences.


Qt Creator is an IDE produced by the Qt Company. It integrates multiple tools including 
a code editor, a Graphical UI (GUI) designer, a compiler, a debugger, Qt Designer, Qt 
Quick Designer, and Qt Assistant, among others.
Qt Designer helps in designing widget-based GUIs whereas Qt Quick Designer provides 
a UI to create and edit QML-based GUIs in Design Mode. Qt Assistant is an integrated 
documentation viewer that opens contents related to a given Qt class or function with the 
press of the F1 key.
