# Qt Framework

The complete software development framework

The Qt framework contains a comprehensive set of highly intuitive and modularized C++ library classes and is loaded with APIs to simplify your application development. 
Qt produces highly readable, easily maintainable and reusable code with high runtime performance and small footprint – and it's cross-platform.

## Qt ESSENTIALS
Making true cross-platform possible
Qt Essentials define the foundation of Qt on all platforms. They are available on all supported development platforms and on the tested target platforms.

Qt Core
Core non-graphical classes used by other modules.



Qt GUI
Base classes for graphical user interface components. Includes OpenGL.


Qt Multimedia
Classes for audio, video, radio and camera functionality.


Qt Network
Classes to make network programming easier and more portable.


Qt Quick
